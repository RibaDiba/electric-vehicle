## Project Summary

This project is for the "Electric Vehicle" event for the Science Olympiad competion. We decided to go with a custom 3D printed chasis for cost and the ability to adjust our gear ratio. 

We chose to use an ESP32 and a single motor controlling the two back wheels. Our design was created using [Onshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/bae78f8b06deb5bece435ea6/w/24b3d8710298e2b6ed3333c5/e/88e4c360c739f0c1e59d8dbb?renderMode=0&uiState=68affed82a809a6f55a7a614).
